C# (pronounced See sharp)[b] is a general-purpose high-level programming language supporting multiple paradigms. C# encompasses static typing,[16]: 4  strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic,[16]: 22  object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines.[17]

The C# programming language was designed by Anders Hejlsberg from Microsoft in 2000 and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270) in 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Visual Studio, both of which were closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform. Mono also joined Microsoft but was not merged into .NET.

As of November 2022, the most recent stable version of the language is C# 11.0, which was released in 2022 in .NET 7.0.[18][19]

Microsoft has invested substantially in ensuring that C# is the dominant language today, spending two billion dollars on marketing and attempting to convince developers to embrace this new platform, which is also based on the.NET foundation.

The .NET framework is incredibly popular among many developers; if you looked right now and said C# is dead, there would be no 88.000 C# employment in the United States.

C# is being integrated into every platform, including desktop, online, future technologies, gaming, and services. So, absolutely, you should study C# right now since it will offer you the best chance of getting in and will keep you employed as you advance in your career.

You can see that C# is completely everywhere right now. Anyone who claims that it is no longer helpful is totally incorrect. In fact, learning C# is the finest choice you have right now, while you are reading this post.

So, if you’re wondering if C# is dying, don’t worry; it’s really expanding at an exponential pace.

C# is a programming language that is worth learning. If you know the basics, then the skills that you learn will be applicable to a wide variety of platforms and can be used to create anything.

You can use it as a Full Stack language and programming in C# will be the best decision. In 2023, It will be a widely used language and is widely recognized among other programming languages such as Java and Python.
